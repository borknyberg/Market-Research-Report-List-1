<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Computer Cooling Fans Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Axial Fans</li><li>Centrifugal Fans</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The computer cooling fans market primarily encompasses two types: axial fans and centrifugal fans. Axial fans move air parallel to the fan shaft, creating a linear airflow, making them ideal for general cooling in computer cases. They are typically quieter and more efficient for low-resistance applications. In contrast, centrifugal fans draw air into their center and expel it at a 90-degree angle, generating higher pressure and airflow, which is suitable for dense or high-performance cooling needs in compact spaces.</p></p>
