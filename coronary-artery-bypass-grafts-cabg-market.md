<p><h1>Coronary Artery Bypass Grafts (CABG) Market Size, Share & Trends Analysis Report By Material, By Type, By End-user, By Region, And Segment Forecasts, 2025 - 2032</h1></p><p><strong>Coronary Artery Bypass Grafts (CABG) Market Analysis and Latest Trends</strong></p>
<p><p>Coronary Artery Bypass Grafts (CABG) is a surgical procedure used to treat coronary artery disease by improving blood flow to the heart. During CABG, surgeons take a healthy artery or vein from another part of the body and attach it to the coronary arteries, bypassing narrowed or blocked sections. This procedure is often recommended for patients experiencing severe chest pain or those with significant artery blockages that can't be treated effectively with medication or angioplasty.</p><p>The CABG market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 12.1% during the forecast period, driven by an increasing prevalence of coronary artery disease globally. Factors contributing to market growth include the rising geriatric population, greater awareness of cardiovascular diseases, and advancements in surgical technologies. Additionally, the integration of minimally invasive techniques and improved postoperative outcomes are enhancing the appeal of CABG. Emerging trends include the use of biological grafts and innovations in perfusion technology, which aim to improve the efficacy and safety of the procedure. As the demand for effective cardiac interventions rises, the CABG market is poised for significant expansion, reflecting ongoing developments in cardiovascular health and surgical practices.</p></p>
